# **2D Free Surface Simulation**

The free surface of a fluid is the surface of a fluid that has zero parallel shear stress, such as the interface between two homogeneous fluids, such as liquid water and air in the Earth's atmosphere. Gases, unlike liquids, cannot form a free surface on their own. A free surface can form in fluidized/liquified solids such as slurries, granular materials, and powders.

If a liquid in a gravitational field is not confined from above, it will form a free surface. Under mechanical equilibrium, the free surface must be perpendicular to the forces acting on the liquid; otherwise, a force along the surface would exist, and the liquid would flow in that direction. Thus, unless disturbed, all free surfaces of liquids on the Earth's surface are horizontal. (except near solids dipping into them, where surface tension distorts the surface in a region called the meniscus).

Internal attractive forces play no role in a free liquid that is not affected by outside forces such as a gravitational field. (e.g. Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds). Its free surface will take on the shape that has the least surface area for its volume: a perfect sphere. Surface tension can be used to describe such behavior. It can be demonstrated experimentally by placing a large globule of oil below the surface of a mixture of water and alcohol with the same density, resulting in neutral buoyancy for the oil.
